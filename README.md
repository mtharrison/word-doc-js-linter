# word-doc-js-linter
Reads js listings from a word doc and lints them.

I made this for my book hapi.js in action to manage the nightmare of keeping the quality of code listings inside word docs high.

At the moment it's designed for my very personal use case but perhaps someday I will adapt it to be a more useful tool for other authors.
